- one page has a "join" function but this isn't OSINT and there's nothing else on the page + no source code so leave that aside for now
- The login page though could be something
- logging in with `user: admin; password: password` leads to an 
	- `Error: Unsafe Input detected` which is interesting cuz we didn't use a payload 
	- using the string "password" triggers it for.... some reason(**irrelevant in the end**)
- nothing else was interesting so moved over to Burpsuite which shows some interesting headers in the response:
	- It has the `X-Frame-Options: DENY` header which combats clickjacking
		- makes it some HTML elements like `<iframe>` can't be rendered
	- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode-block` header for obviously protecting against XSS attacks
	- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'` header for an extra layer of protection against XSS and similar cross-site attacks
	- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` prevents referrer headers being sent elsewhere
	- also no cache poisoning can be done according to numerous headers
- Suffice it to say I don't think XSS is the solution here particularly as none of the fields jump out as fitting the format.
- And without the source whether it's a SSRF or SSTI attack is also up in the air so it's probably something else
- Since it's an "easy" challenge let's try logging in as just admin with a SQL injection
- Just used `user: admin` but for password I went down through this [SQL Payloads List](https://github.com/payloadbox/sql-injection-payload-list) and eventually you get a hit
- Flag is in the page you unlock ![|400](Pasted%20image%2020241028104536.png)

#### Paranormal-Pictures
- This one comes with source code for the website with a basic check for if you try to get the flag
- ![|450](Pasted%20image%2020241026155148.png)
- Try to add an `X-Forwarded-For` header into our burpsuite-repeater and it leads to the alarm.html   ![|325](Pasted%20image%2020241026155316.png)
- It interestingly has this though in the base page ![|450](Pasted%20image%2020241026160417.png)
- If you can pass the check then it will fetch the URL and render it
- pass it something random like `wikipedia/real/cryptid/blog/666/.org/` and you can see rendered gibberish
- First thought was can I use it to render "flag.html" for me?
	- `payload: http://paranormal-picture.niccgetsspooky.xyz/real/cryptid/blog/666/.org/../../../../../flag`
	- This gets it past the check but then uses multiple `/../` to escape out of the fake directories I gave it
	- result: ![|475](Pasted%20image%2020241026174034.png)
	- Trying to get to the raw file with this also didn't get me the flag
		- `payload: http://paranormal-picture.niccgetsspooky.xyz/real/cryptid/blog/666/.org/../../../../../templates/flag.html (notice the "/templates/")

- Solution:
	- The above idea is correct, it's all correct but we're simply querying it wrong as is when it tries to **fetch()** the webpage it's doing it as a "civilian" so to speak
	- We need to simply change it so that it does it as itself as the localhost 
	- Thankfully the source files tell us which port it's running on  ![](Pasted%20image%2020241026175033.png)
	- So just change the payload to 
		- `http://localhost:80/real/cryptid/blog/666/.org/../../../../../flag`
	- **Flag**:   NICC{tHe_crYptIds_aRe_waIting_t0_sTrike}
